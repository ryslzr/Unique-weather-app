# Unique Cozy Weather Widget App

##  Overview

This project is a unique cozy, sprightly animated weather widget app built to deepen my understanding of APIs, Node.js, and full-stack development. It blends technical functionality with a Studio Ghibli-inspired aesthetic to create a warm and engaging user experience.

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **Design Tool**: Figma  
- **Weather API**: OpenWeatherMap  

---

##  Objectives

- Learn and apply **Node.js** for backend development  
- Create a **custom Express server**  
- Integrate **OpenWeather API** for real-time weather data  
- Build a **React-based frontend** with dynamic UI  
- Design a **cozy aesthetic** with soft color palettes and sprigthly animations  
- Add **persona-driven speech bubbles** and **mood-based UI changes**

| **Cozy Aesthetic** | Soft color palettes and pixelated flame spirit inspired by Calcifer from *Howl's Moving Castle* |
| **Narrative Speech Bubbles** | Example: `"Looks like a perfect day for a blanket and tea. ‚òÅÔ∏èüçµ"` |
| **Custom Moods** | Sleepy, Productive, Introvert ‚Äî each with unique speech and future layout changes |
| **Auto Mood Switch** | Random mood selected daily |
| **Day/Night Cycle** | UI and flame spirit color change based on time (e.g., 20:00 UK time triggers night mode) |
| **Temperature Toggle** *(Planned)* | Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit |
| **Persona Animation** | Flame spirit changes tone:  
  - Day: Orange, Red, Yellow  
  - Night: Blue, Cyan, Purple |
